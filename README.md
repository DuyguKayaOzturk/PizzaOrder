Decorator Pattern

Creating and explaining a solution that uses the decorator pattern

We need to research and build a solution that implements the decorator pattern.



Code:

The solution should model the creation of pizzas in memory.

All pizzas will start with some kind of base:

- Regular Base
- Thick Case
- Gluten Free Base



The pizza will then be 'decorated' with toppings.

There should be no real limit to the number of materials added when using a decorator pattern.

Each topping should have a relevant description added to the pizza, as well as a price that should be recorded.

The system should randomly generate at least 3 pizzas and print a description and final price for each.
